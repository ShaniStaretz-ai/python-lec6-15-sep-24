## learned subjects:

1) loop else: 
    In while loop, when the condition in the while is TRUE you can add the else and the next action

    example: (see full code in while)
    ```
    while num!=777:
   ....
        if num==0:
            break;
   else: 
        print("well done")
    ```
   usage: if there is a break in the loop, you cannot know what was the exit value, therefore this else help to know that the exit value was the value from the while condition and not because of the break in the loop. 
## Extra:

* if you write a constant parameter, that doesn't change you can write the parameter with all capital letters.

    i.e: PIE:float=3.14
